# Word_game
This is a word game that is similar to Scrabble. The player has the option to play a hand that generates "n" letters or let the computer play the same hand. The word submitted is scored based on points for each letter in the word (that is similar to Scrabble's point system), and if all of the letters in the hand are used, 50 points will be added to the score. If there are remaining letters in the hand after a word is played, the player can submit more words based on those letters, play a new hand, or quit the game entirely. The total score is displayed when the game is over.
